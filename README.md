![App Illustration](./images/zoo1.png)|![App Illustration](./images/zoo2.png)

This app can display animal list plus their images and name
.It can also display more details about each animal and 
dangerous animals have a red boundary. This is a simple 
app designed with only a listview and no card view. It's a beginner level project
that I did in my Android class.
